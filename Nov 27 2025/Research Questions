Potential research questions for the project:

MW/M31 Halo Major Merger Remnant Structure

Density profile of combined MW+M31 halo; comparison to original profiles and standard profiles (Hernquist, NFW, Isothermal Sphere).

Shape of the dark matter halo (triaxial, oblate, prolate) and its evolution over time.

Contribution of MW vs. M31 particles to density, shape, and kinematics; spatial orientation and angular momentum.

Definition of halo “edge” (R200, Rvir, splashback radius).

MW/M31 Halo Major Merger Remnant Kinematics

Rotation of the combined halo; relation to halo spin.

Velocity dispersion profile and comparison to virial theorem or Wolf Mass Estimator.

Average specific angular momentum; comparison to pre-merger halos.

Escape speed as a function of radius.
